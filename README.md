This will remove the default MFL styling and allow our custom theme to take effect.

## Theme Configuration (Tailwind CSS)

The theme's visual appearance is primarily controlled by `tailwind.config.js` and `src/styles/index.css`.

### Color Palette

The core color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js` is:

- `bg`: `#22252b` (Main background)
- `card`: `#2d3038` (Card/container background)
- `alt`: `#2a2d35` (Alternative background or subtle elements)
- `accent`: `#32e3c0` (Primary accent color)
- `text`: `#e3e7ee` (Main text color)

These can be used with Tailwind's utility classes, e.g., `bg-bg`, `text-accent`, `border-card`.

### Typography

- Default font: Inter (sans-serif stack).
- Applied to the `body` via `@apply font-sans` in `src/styles/index.css`.

### Utility Classes & Components

Several global utility classes and component styles are defined in `src/styles/index.css`:

- `.card`: Applies base styling for card-like containers (`bg-card`, `rounded-xl`, `shadow-sm`, `shadow-alt`, `p-4`).
  Example: `<div class="card">...</div>`
- `.glow-hover`: Adds a subtle glow effect on hover using the `accent` color.
  Can be applied to interactive elements: `<button class="btn-primary glow-hover">...</button>`
- `.deg-bar`: A decorative gradient bar (often used as a visual accent).
  Example: `<div class="deg-bar"></div>`
- `.btn-primary`: Primary button style (`bg-accent`, `text-bg`, padding, rounding, `glow-hover`).
  Example: `<button class="btn-primary">Click Me</button>`
- `.badge`: Small, rounded element for displaying status or short info (`bg-alt`, `text-accent`).
  Example: `<span class="badge">New</span>`
- `.pill`: Pill-shaped element, often for tags or categories (`bg-card`, `text-text`, `border-alt`).
  Example: `<span class="pill">Category</span>`

## Responsive Navigation (Burger Menu)

The header navigation is responsive:
- On small screens (less than `sm` breakpoint defined by Tailwind, typically 640px), a "burger" button (`#burgerBtn`) is shown.
- Clicking the burger button toggles the visibility of the main navigation menu (`#mainNav`).
- The navigation menu stacks vertically on mobile.
- On larger screens (`sm` and up), the burger button is hidden, and the navigation menu is displayed horizontally.

### How it Works
- Logic is handled in `src/main.js`.
- The script listens for clicks on `#burgerBtn`.
- It toggles the `hidden` and `flex` (or other display utility) classes on `#mainNav`.
- `aria-expanded` attribute on `#burgerBtn` is updated to reflect the state of the navigation menu, aiding accessibility.
- Focus styles (`focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-accent`) are applied to the burger button for keyboard navigation.

### Active Link Highlighting
- `src/main.js` also includes a helper function (`MFL_setActiveLink`) that highlights the active navigation link based on the current `window.location.hash`.
- It adds the `text-accent` class to the active link and ensures other links use `text-text`.
- This runs on initial page load and whenever the URL hash changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring your League ID & Refresh Cadences

To connect the theme to your specific MFL league and customize data refresh rates, you'll need to configure it.

1.  **Copy the Example Configuration:**
    Make a copy of `src/config.example.js` and name it `src/config.js`.
    ```bash
    cp src/config.example.js src/config.js
    ```
2.  **Edit `src/config.js`:**
    Open `src/config.js` and replace the placeholder `MFL_LEAGUE_ID` with your actual MFL league ID.
    You can also adjust the `REFRESH_INTERVALS` for how often different types of data should be fetched (values are in milliseconds).

    ```javascript
    export const MFL_LEAGUE_ID = "YOUR_LEAGUE_ID_HERE"; // Replace with your MFL League ID

    export const REFRESH_INTERVALS = {
      scores: 30000,        // 30 seconds
      standings: 3600000,   // 1 hour
      transactions: 600000, // 10 minutes
    };
    ```
3.  **Important:** Add `src/config.js` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already there to avoid committing your specific league ID to the repository, especially if the repository is public.

    ```
    # .gitignore
    src/config.js
    ```

This configuration will be used by the data fetching logic (detailed in `docs/data-strategy.md`) to pull information from your league.

## üöÄ Live Data Flow & Setup

This theme uses a serverless caching strategy to fetch and display live MFL data efficiently and reliably.

1.  **Data Fetching (Netlify Function):**
    *   A Netlify serverless function, defined in `netlify/functions/fetch-mfl.js`, runs on a schedule (configurable via cron expressions in `netlify.toml` or the Netlify UI).
    *   This function fetches the latest data (scores, standings, transactions, finances) from the MFL API.
    *   The fetched data is saved as JSON files (e.g., `standings.json`, `scores.json`) into the `docs/data/` directory of your deployed site.
    *   You will need to set the `MFL_LEAGUE_ID` environment variable in your Netlify site settings for this function to target your league.

2.  **Data Hosting (GitHub Pages):**
    *   The `docs/data/` directory, containing the cached JSON files, is part of your site published via GitHub Pages.
    *   This means the cached data is accessible via URLs like `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/mfl-2025-theme/data/standings.json`.

3.  **Client-Side Fetching (Fetch Wrapper):**
    *   The theme's front-end uses a JavaScript wrapper `src/lib/mflApi.js`.
    *   This wrapper fetches the JSON data files from the GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/mfl-2025-theme/data/standings.json`).
    *   It includes in-memory caching to avoid redundant fetches if data hasn't changed or is within its refresh interval (defined in `src/config.js`).

4.  **GitHub Actions Fallback (Cache Workflow):**
    *   A GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/cache.yml` provides a fallback mechanism for caching data.
    *   It runs on pushes to the main branch and on a nightly schedule.
    *   This workflow executes `scripts/fetch-mfl-data.js` (which contains similar logic to the Netlify function) to fetch data and commits any changes directly to the `docs/data/` directory in the repository.
    *   For this workflow to commit changes, it requires a `MFL_LEAGUE_ID` repository secret and uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
    *   **Important for Forks:** If you fork this repository, ensure you enable GitHub Actions (if not enabled by default) and set the `MFL_LEAGUE_ID` secret in your fork's settings for the cache to be updated.

### Deploying with Netlify (Recommended for Scheduled Functions)

To get the automated, scheduled data fetching via Netlify Functions:

1.  Click the button below to deploy this repository to Netlify:
    [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dock108/mfl-2025-theme) 
    *(Replace `dock108/mfl-2025-theme` in the URL if your repository URL is different, e.g., after forking)*
2.  Follow the Netlify setup steps.
3.  In your new Netlify site's settings (under Build & deploy > Environment), add an environment variable:
    *   **Key:** `MFL_LEAGUE_ID`
    *   **Value:** Your MFL league ID (e.g., `12345`)
4.  Netlify will automatically build your site from the `docs` directory and deploy the function from `netlify/functions`. The scheduled execution of the function is defined by its cron pattern (see comments in `fetch-mfl.js` and `netlify.toml` for guidance on setting this up if not done automatically via a UI).

## üü¢ Live Scoreboard Module

The theme includes a live scoreboard that replaces MFL's native live scoring interface. It displays matchups with team names, logos (placeholders if not available from MFL), current scores, a win probability bar, and a fake "Vegas" line.

### Features:
-   **Live Updates:** Scores automatically refresh at the interval defined in `src/config.js` (default is every 30 seconds for scores).
-   **Win Probability & Line:** A helper function in `src/lib/vegas.js` calculates:
    -   **Win Probability:** Based on the current score differential using a logistic formula. Tuned so a 7-point lead gives the leading team approximately 73% win probability.
    -   **Vegas Line:** A simplified spread, typically half the point difference, rounded to the nearest 0.5 (e.g., "Team A -3.5").
-   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes (1-column on mobile, 2 on medium screens, 3 on larger screens).
-   **Visual Flair:** Uses the theme's `Card` component and `ProbBar` for a modern look. Score changes and hover effects are animated.

```
*(A real screenshot should be added here once the module is visually complete and deployed.)*

### How it Works:
1.  The `Scoreboard` React component (`src/modules/Scoreboard.jsx`) is rendered into the `#scoreboard` div in the main HTML layout.
2.  It uses the `getScores()` function from `src/lib/mflApi.js` to fetch the latest `scores.json` data from the cached location (e.g., GitHub Pages via Netlify function updates).
3.  For each matchup, it displays team information and uses `calculateVegasLine()` to generate the win probability and line.
4.  CSS in `src/styles/index.css` hides MFL's default live scoring tables.
